# DesafioTecnico

For this project, I used the MVVM architecture and Combine to implement reactive programming. Although this was unnecessary for a project of this size, the reasoning behind this choice was that it was listed as a requirement in the job description.

I also implemented CocoaPods to manage dependencies and the GoogleMaps library to add the user location feature to the app.

The UI is unpolished but functional due to time constraints. However, I am aware that there is room for improvement.

Basic unit tests for the networking layer were added. If the UI were more complex, it could have included Snapshot tests as well.
